# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Awesome German Academic Corpora list!

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

## Adding to the List

- Make sure the resource is related to German language academic corpora, linguistic resources, or tools for German language research.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- Link additions should be added alphabetically within their category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should start with a capital letter and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

## Quality Standards

- The resource should be high-quality and well-maintained.
- The resource should be accessible (free or with reasonable access options for researchers).
- Academic resources should be properly documented.
- Tools should have clear documentation and usage instructions.

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your pull request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a pull request and the different ways you can do that.

## Language Versions

When adding content to the list, please:

- Add the resource to all three language versions (English, Japanese, and German) if possible.
- Maintain consistency across translations.
- If you're only comfortable with one language, that's okay - add it to one version and note in your PR that translations are needed.

Thank you for your contribution!
